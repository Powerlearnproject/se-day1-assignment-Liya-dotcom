Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- It is the systematic application of engineering principles and tools for developing and maintaining high-quality software systems. 
- It plays a huge role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power the aspects of modern life, e.g. communication, commerce, entertainment, and the healthcare industry.
   
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Mastering Complexity
- Mastering Process
- Mastering Machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards.
- Development: Release the software to the user or customer.
- Maintenance: Provide support, updates, and enhancements to the software after development.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: Linear and sequential approach with distinct phases.
  - Flowing  downwards like a waterfall.
  - Low in flexibility
  - Changes are hard to be implemented when the phase is completed.
  - Tests are usually done after development process.
- Agile:  Iterate and incremental approach focused on flexibility and collaboration.
    - High in flexibility, adapting to changing requirements
    -  Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint
    -  Testing is continuous and done after each iteration

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- Integrated Development Environment: Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, 
  debugging, and testing code
    - Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows 
      these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the 
      source code.
    - IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are 
      typically part of every code change
      e.g
      - Visual Studio
      - Eclipse
      - IntelliJ IDEA
     
- Version Control Systems(VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and
  coordinating work among team members.
   - Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
   - Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each 
     modification.
     e.g
       - Git
       - Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
- Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
- Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures.
  - Solutions:
      - Effective communication
      - Agile Methodologies
      - Prioritization of tasks
      - Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
        
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
- Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
- System Testing: Testing the software againstthe  software system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
    - Importance: Quality control measures such as code reviews automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-  Prompt engineering:  This is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
-  Importance:
 - Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
 - Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
 - Developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI.
 - Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Clarity: The improved prompt specifies the subject (a young man), his appearance (short hair, white golf T-shirt, blue jeans), and the setting (a sunny park with trees and grass). This eliminates ambiguity and ensures the artist knows exactly what to draw.

- Specificity: By detailing the clothing, hairstyle, and environment, the prompt provides a clear mental image, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation.

- Conciseness: While more detailed, the improved prompt is still concise and avoids unnecessary information, making it easy to follow.

- Context: Adding the sunny day and park setting creates a vivid scene, helping the artist visualize the mood and atmosphere.
